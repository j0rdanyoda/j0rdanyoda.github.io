### CPSC 120

* Lab 6, part 2

    The reason why this lab is my favorite is because I am new into playing blackjack with my friends, without money. And I always wanted to know how it works and how it goes. This lab has taught me how to understand blackjack. And to write code to where it can show the user and calculate the cards to the user, giving them the option to hit or stand on their cards.

* Lab 7, part 1

    This is also my favorite lab because we wrote functions to tell us the possible parking availability on any street throughout any time of the day. It taught me how to write functions that can run, and possibly show me the best times to park anywhere.


* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab was my third favorite out of all the other labs, because it made us implement a spell checker. Where we give the computer its own dictionary, and have it compare to another text file to see if any of the text is spelled correctly. Aswell as adding Input Validation, in order to check if the user has imputed the correct argument, with not too many, not less , or even putting in the right text file.
